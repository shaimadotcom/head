# head

pretty simple nothing much to explain but i will try my best, i lost track of how many parts are there -thats why i uplaoded it as an CD4 file so you can check it out yourself and let me know- but the mane 3 parts are: base, neck, cap(top half of the head) and jaw.


### the head
#### the head is pretty simple the mouth containing(speaker,arduino board, wave shield, sd card..) is shaped in a certin way to allow the robot to speak witn a better resonace and to make it fun the eyes part of the robot is going to have LEDDMX that can do various eyes patterns and such.
### neck mechanisn:
#### i tried to disgin it so the head can move in three accesses (up and down, side to side, and a full rotation)
#### the neck can rottate a full 360, at the bottom it has holders for the two MG995 servo motors that will allow the head to swivel, and on the top thers an access that will be make noding an easy task for the robot head and on top of that theres another access that will allow the robot head to tilt.
### assembly:
#### its easy, you attach the base to the chest piece and on top of that goes the neck with the servo motors attached to the holders and the top access with the tiliting piece on, then goes the head on top of them all witha metal rods ends attached to the servo motors to keep everything secure.
